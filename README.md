##Summary
This is a lightweight and focused library. The Java class currently only includes 6 methods. More features are planned that will obviously add to the method count in the future. 

This library can be used in an infinite amount of ways:
- generate initial passwords for your user based applications   
- suggest character names in your games
- find a unique name for your child
- the list goes on...

##Usage
Using the library is extremely simple.

Simply create a RandomWord object:
	RandomWord myWordGenerator = new RandomWord();
And use the getNewWord method to generate a new random word on demand:
	String myNewWord = myWordGenerator.getNewWord(int lengthOfWord);

##Downloads
###Gradle (preferred):

Add the jitpack repository:

	allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
		}
	}

Then add the gradle dependency:

	dependencies {
	        compile 'com.github.maximeroussy:invitrode:v1.0.0'
	}

###Maven:

Add the jitpack repository:

	<repositories>
		<repository>
		    <id>jitpack.io</id>
		    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
		</repository>
	</repositories>

Then add the Maven dependency:

	<dependency>
	    <groupId>com.github.maximeroussy</groupId>
	    <artifactId>invitrode</artifactId>
	    <version>v1.0.0</version>

The alternative method is downloading the [latest JAR](https://github.com/maximeroussy/invitrode/archive/1.0.5.zip)  to include yourself in your projects.

##Inspiration & Credits
Bi-gram source and general concept based on [Scrollback's generate.js](https://github.com/scrollback/scrollback/blob/master/lib/generate.js)  & described in [this blog post](https://www.hackerearth.com/notes/random-pronouncable-text-generator/)  by Aravind. This is a Java adaptation that will be further developed as a functional and feature rich random word generator.
